SMUBIA sported its inaugural participation at SMU’s annual interest group recruitment drive, VIVACE 2017.

Online media has cast a spotlight on data analytics as the next big competency of organisations globally; and the global shortage of data practitioners has been dubbed by business leaders in the likes of Alibaba’s Jack Ma, and Microsoft’s Satya Nadella. It is no surprise that SMU’s student community were eager to discover learning and career opportunities in data analytics.

As SMU’s first interest group focused on data analytics, SMUBIA’s showcase booth generated strong interest amongst local and overseas exchange students, eager to find out about the interest group’s offerings. Members of the executive team shared about SMUBIA’s unique co-learning platform, regular industry talks and data project opportunities, and guided a diverse demographic of students to sign up as a member of SMUBIA.

> With the industry push for data-driven business decision making and data talent, the time is ripe for a focused learning group to bolster analytics skillset development efforts among students.
> 
> – David Chin, Director of Public Relations at SMUBIA. 

Amongst the estimated 70 interest groups showcased at VIVACE, SMUBIA set itself apart by publishing a live analytics tracker of on-site membership signups for the club at VIVACE, and also featured case studies where data analytics had successfully driven clear business outcomes for the largest companies in the most competitive industries. 

A third of membership sign-ups came from SMU’s Information Systems faculty, where students have developed a strong programming background and are willing to offer their knowledge and skills in contribution to the interest group’s co-learning initiative. Students from the business faculty took up the second third of membership sign-ups. Candid conversations reveal a keen eagerness to understand the technology behind data analytics, so that they could apply the capabilities as a value-add to their future employing organisations.

As VIVACE came to a close, almost 250 students from across SMU’s five major faculties have signed up as members of SMUBIA.
